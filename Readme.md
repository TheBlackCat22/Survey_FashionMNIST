## Dataset
Fashion MNIST

## Description
- Image Size = 1x28x28
- Num Classes = 10
- Num Training Samples = 60000 (5000 Val?)
- Num Testing Samples = 10000

## Methods
### Augmentation
(Can be attempted later if best model is Overfitting)
- Auto Augmentation
- Handpicked (Random Horizontal Flip, Random Vertical Flip, Random Rotation, Random Resized Crop)
### Feature Extraction
- Flatten
- Traditional Feature extraction Techniques (Need to pick a one or two)
- ResNet (CNN based Feature Extractors) 
- Vit (Transformer based Feature Extractors) 
### Dimensionality Reduction
- Chi Square Test
- Anova Test
- PCA
- SVD
### Models
- Naive Bayes
- Nearest Neighbor
- Decision Trees
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- SVM
- Dense Perceptron Layers
- Transformer
### Loss Functions
- Cross Entropy
- Is there a better loss function? Can we add auxilary losses maybe?
### Explainability
- Grad-CAM
## Implement SOTA
If we have time
